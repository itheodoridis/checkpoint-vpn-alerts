# checkpoint-vpn-alerts
scripts and nagios plugins to check vpn user numbers and health and performance stats
These scripts and nagios plugins are created in an effort to automate checks and alerts due to increasing number of remote vpn users connecting to a corporate checkpoint firewall cluster, during the COVID-19 Crisis.
Will update this according to changes.

I have read and used a similar structure of this plugin https://github.com/mhoogveld/check_cisco_ip_sla by https://github.com/mhoogveld
